[CData Connect](https://www.cdata.com/connect) is a consolidated connectivity platform that links applications, on-premises or in the cloud to a broad ecosystem of real-time data sources through consistent, standards-compliant interfaces. CData Connect Cloud provides tools to seamlessly access data from any system, anywhere.

The CData Connect [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) driver library bundles the latest [CData Connect JDBC driver](https://cloud.cdata.com/docs/JDBC.html) through Ballerina. With this library, you can programmatically access all of the CData Connect applications, databases, APIs, services and query these data.
